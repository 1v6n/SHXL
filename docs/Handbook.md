### ✒️ Policy deck

---

## 🃏 Cards and Decks

In *Secret Hitler*, there are effectively **two physical decks** involved in gameplay:

### 🃏 1. **Policy Deck (Draw Pile)**

* This is the **main deck** from which the **President draws 3 policy cards** during the Legislative Phase.
* It contains **Liberal**, **Communist** and **Fascist** policy tiles.
* Often labeled as the **Draw Deck** or **Draw Pile**.

### 🗑️ 2. **Discard Pile**

* When a policy card is discarded (by President or Chancellor), it goes here **face down**.
* When the Policy Deck runs out, the discard pile is **shuffled to replenish** it.

### 🏷️ Bonus: **Envelopes / Role Cards**

* While not a deck, each player has a **Secret Role + Party Membership** pair in an envelope.

---

## 🗳️ Game Phases

Secret Hitler is played in rounds, each has different phases.

### 🧪 Setup Phase

* Create envelopes for each player with:

  * 1 Secret Role card
  * 1 Party Membership card, so secret roles aren't revealed.
  * 1 Ja! and 1 Nein ballot cards
* Roles and party membership are secret. Shuffle and distribute randomly.
* Use appropriate board and policy deck (shuffle them and place that deck face down on the Draw pile card).
* Shuffle the envelopes and each player should get one envelope selected at random

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ Opening Phase

* Randomly select the first Presidential Candidate and pass that player both the President and Chancellor placards.
* **¿Fascist know who Hitler is?:**
  * Less than 8 players: Fascist and Hitler open eyes and acknowledge each other while the others have their eyes closed.
  * 8+ players:
    * Everyone extend your hands into a fist right in from of you, and then close your eyes
    * Fascists (not Hitler) open your eyes.
    * Hitler raises thumb while keeping eyes closed.
    * Fascists identify Hitler and close their eyes.
    * Everyone open your eyes.
* **¿Communist know each other?:**
  * Less than 11 players: communists **do know each other**.
  * 11+ players: communists **don’t know each other**.

---

### 🧑‍⚖️ Election Phase (round start)

This phase aims to form a government

1. After the first round, President placard moves clockwise to the next player.
2. New president candidate nominates a Chancellor by passing the Chancellor placard.
   * The president is free to discuss Chancellor options with the table to build consensus and make the Government more likely to get elected
   * **Term Limits:**

     * Previous **elected** (not nominated) President/Chancellor are not eligible (this only applies to Chancellor candidate, anyone can be President, even someone who was just Chancellor).
     * If there are only 7 players left, only the last elected Chancellor is not eligible to be candidate and the last President may be nominated.
3. All players (including the candidates) discuss the proposed government and vote Ja!/Nein simultaneously.

   * If majority votes Ja!, government is elected.
     * 🏆 If 3 or more fascist policies have been enacted, ask if the new chancellor is Hitler. If so, the game is over and the fascist win. Otherwise, the other players know for sure the Chancellor is not Hitler.
   * If the vote fails or is a tie, The Presidential Candidate misses this chance to be elected, and the
President placard moves clockwise to the next player. Advance **Election Tracker** by one Election.
   * If 3 failed governments in a row: top policy is auto-enacted.
     * Any power granted by this policy is ignored
     * The Election Tracker resets, and existing term-limits are forgotten. All players become eligible to be Chancellor for next Election.
     * If there are fewer than 3 tiles remaining in the Policy deck, shuffle them with the Discard pile to create a new Policy deck

Any time a new policy tile is played face-up, the Election Tracker is reset, whether it was enacted by an elected government or enacted by the frustrated populace.

#### 📝 Election Tracker

Counter that tracks failed government formation attempts.

* Every time the table **rejects a proposed government** (via majority *Nein* vote), the Election Tracker advances by 1.
* If the tracker reaches **3 failed elections in a row**, the country descends into **chaos**:

  * The **top policy card** of the draw pile is automatically enacted **without player input**.
  * Any **presidential powers** associated with that policy are **ignored**.
  * The tracker resets to 0, and **term limits are lifted** for the next round.

This mechanic prevents players from indefinitely blocking the formation of a government and adds pressure to vote strategically.

---

### 📜 Legislative Phase

This phase aims to enact a new policy

* President draws 3 policy tiles, discards 1 face-down it to the Discard pile.
* Gives the 2 remaining tiles at the same time to Chancellor, who discards 1 and enacts the other.
* Enacted policy is placed face-up on the corresponding tracker.
* 🚫 **No communication is allowed** during policy selection.

If **there are fewer than three tiles remaining in the Policy deck** at the end of a Legislative Session, shuffle them with the Discard pile to create a new Policy deck. Unused Policy tiles should never be revealed, and they should not be simply placed on top of the new Policy deck.

If the **government enacted a Fascist or Communist Policy** that covered up a Presidential Power, the sitting President gets to use that power. Proceed to the 🧨 Executive Action.

If the **government enacted a Liberal Policy or a Policy that grants no Presidential Power for some reason**, begin a new round with a new Election.

#### ⛔ Veto Power

* Permanent ability available **after 5 Fascist policies** where the Chancellor may propose veto.
* The President draws three Policy tiles, discards one, and passes the remaining two to the Chancellor as usual. Then Chancellor may, instead of enacting either Policy, say “I wish to veto this agenda.”
  * If the President consents by saying, “I agree to the veto,” both Policies are discarded and the President placard passes to the left as usual.
  * If not, Chancellor must enact a Policy.
* Each use of the Veto Power represents an inactive government and advances the Election Tracker by one

---

### 🧨 Executive Action (Fascist or Communist Policy Only)

This phase aims to exercise governmental power.

* If the fascist or communist policy covers a power slot:

  * President must use it immediately. Gameplay cannot continue until the President uses the power.
  * Before using a power, the President is free to discuss the issue with other players, but ultimately the President gets to decide how and when the power is used. Presidential Powers are used only once; they don’t stack or roll over to future turns.

#### 🥸 Fascist Presidential powers

* *Investigate Loyalty:* the president asks for the Party Membership card of a player and checks their party affiliation in secret, and then returns it to the player. The president can then share or lie the results of their investigation. 🚫 **No player can be investigated twice in the same game**
* *Call Special Election:* the president chooses any other player at the table to be the next Presidential Candidate by passing that player the President Placard.
  * The new President nominates an eligible player as Chancellor Candidate and the Election proceeds as usual.
    * 🔁 A Special Election does not skip any players. After a Special Election, the President placard returns to the left of the President who enacted the Special Election.
    * ⚠️ If the President passes the presidency to the next player in the rotation, that player would get to run for President twice in a row: once for the Special Election and once for their normal shift in the Presidential rotation.
* *Policy Peek:* secretly view top 3 tiles.
* *Execution:* eliminate a player
  * If Hitler, Liberals win.
  * If not, the table should not learn the party affiliation of the assassinated.
  * Executed players are removed from the game and may not speak, vote, or run for office.

#### ⚒️ Special Communist Presidential Powers

* *Confession:* president reveals **their** party membership to everyone.
* *Bugging:* communists view another player’s party card.
* *Five-Year Plan:* add 2 communist + 1 liberal policy to draw deck.
* *Congress:* communists learn who the original communists are.
* *Radicalization:* convert a player into a communist by swapping their party card with another in the center of the table (except Hitler, if he is converted, before everyone opens their eyes he must swap his card back).

---

## 🗓️ Events (NEW!)

### 🍺 Oktober Fest

Pick up the 12-months deck and order it from January (upper card) to December (lower card). Then, ask someone to cut the deck however they want and place the lower part on top of the remaining part of the deck.

After each election round, a month goes by.

- When Oktober comes, every player should drink and all their decisions must be done without looking at the contents of their cards.
  - If a president or chancellor must choose a target for their power, make them dizzy by spinning them with their eyes closed and then they can make their decision.

---

## ❌ Anti-Policies (optional)

Anti-Policies help extend the game and balance roles in large groups. They replace standard policies and remove previously enacted ones while blocking the reuse of presidential powers. Use Anti-Fascist and Anti-Communist policies to weaken their respective factions, and Social Democratic policies to aid liberals—only if they are clearly disadvantaged.

* If you are playing with Communist, you might want to swop out a Communists policy with an anti-communist policy and a fascist policy with an anti-fascist policy to extend the game length.

### **Anti-Communist Policy:**

* Replaces one common fascist policy
* Goes on fascist policy tracker when its enacted.
* The president uses their presidential power and removes a communist policy from the communist policy tracker.
* The next time a communist policy is enacted, the president/communists do not get to reuse the communist presidential power.

### **Anti-Fascist Policy:**

* Replaces one common communist policy
* Goes on communist policy tracker when its enacted.
* The president uses their presidential power and removes fascist policy from the fascist policy tracker.
* The next time a fascist policy is enacted, the president does not get to reuse the presidential power.

### **Social Democratic Policy:**

* Replaces one common liberal policy
  * ⚠️ Only use if liberals are significantly disadvantaged.
* Goes on liberal policy tracker when its enacted.
* The president removes either fascist or communist policy from either policy tracker.
* Neither the communists nor the fascists may reuse any presidential powers because of this policy.

---

## 🚨 Emergency Powers (optional)

* **Extend** game time and **Increase** chances for investigations and assassinations so that non-fascist players can assassinate Hitler.
* These cards are not placed on any tracker. Once used, the card is **removed from the game** (one use only)
* 💡 Include **1 emergency card per player over 10** (2 per over 13 if communists are in play). Max: 6 total (3 Article 48, 3 Enabling Acts).

### ✒️ **Article 48 (President)**

* The president gets to enact an emergency power.
