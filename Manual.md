## 🧾 Core Rules from Base Secret Hitler

### 🎭 Secret Roles and Setup

* Each player is secretly assigned a role: **Liberal**, **Fascist**, or **Hitler**.
* 🏆 **Liberals** win by enacting 5 Liberal policies or **assassinating Hitler**.
* 🏆 **Fascists** win by enacting 6 Fascist policies or **electing Hitler Chancellor** after 3 Fascist policies.

#### 🧪 Setup Phase

* Create envelopes for each player with:

  * 1 Secret Role card
  * 1 Party Membership card (liberal or fascist), so Hitler secret role isn't revealed.
  * 1 Ja! and 1 Nein ballot cards
* Roles and party membership are secret. Shuffle and distribute randomly.
* Use appropriate board and policy deck (6 liberal + 11 fascist policies, shuffle them and place that deck face down on the Draw pile card).
* Shuffle the envelopes and each player should get one envelope selected at random

#### 🕵️‍♂️ Opening Phase

* Randomly select the first Presidential Candidate and pass that palyer both the President and Chancellor placards.
* 5–6 players: Fascist and Hitler open eyes and acknowledge each other while the others have their eyes closed.
* 7–10 players:

  * Everyone extend your hands into a fist right in from of you, and then close your eyes
  * Fascists (not Hitler) open your eyes.
  * Hitler raises thumb while keeping eyes closed.
  * Fascists identify Hitler and close their eyes.
  * Everyone open your eyes.

## 🗳️ Game Phases

Secret Hitler is played in rounds, each has different phases.

### 🧑‍⚖️ Election Phase

This phase aims to form a government

1. President placard moves clockwise to the next player.
2. New president candidate nominates a Chancellor by passing the Chancellor placard.
   * The president is free to discuss Chancellor options with the table to build consensus and make the Government more likely to get elected
   * Term Limits:

     * Previous **elected** (not nominated) Pres/Chancellor are not eligible (this only applies to Chancellor candidate, anyone can be President, even someone who was just Chancellor).
     * If there are only 5 players left, only the last elected Chancellor is not eligible to be candidate and the last President may be nominated.
3. All players (including the candidates) discuss the proposed government and vote Ja!/Nein simultaneously.

   * If majority votes Ja!, government is elected.
     * 🏆 If 3 or more fascist policies have been enacted, ask if the new chancellor is Hitler. If so, the game is over and the fascist win. Otherwise, the other players know for sure the Chancellor is not Hitler.
   * If the vote fails or is a tie, The Presidential Candidate misses this chance to be elected, and the
President placard moves clockwise to the next player. Advance **Election Tracker** by one Election.
   * If 3 failed governments in a row: top policy is auto-enacted.
     * Any power granted by this policy is ignored
     * The Election Tracker resets, and existing term-limits are forgotten. All players become eligible to be Chancellor for next Election.
     * If there are fewer than 3 tiles remaining in the Policy deck, shuffle them with the Discard pile to create a new Policy deck

Any time a new policy tile is played face-up, the Election Tracker is reset, whether it was enacted by an elected government or enacted by the frustrated populace.

### 📜 Legislative Phase

This phase aims to enact a new policy

* President draws 3 policy tiles, discards 1 face-down it to the Discard pile.
* Gives the 2 remaining tiles at the same time to Chancellor, who discards 1 and enacts the other.
* Enacted policy is placed face-up on the corresponding tracker.
* 🚫 **No communication is allowed** during policy selection.

If **there are fewer than three tiles remaining in the Policy deck** at the end of a Legislative Session, shuffle them with the Discard pile to create a new Policy deck. Unused Policy tiles should never be revealed, and they should not be simply placed on top of the new Policy deck.

If the **government enacted a Fascist Policy** that covered up a Presidential Power, the sitting
President gets to use that power. Proceed to the 🧨 Executive Action.

If the **government enacted a Liberal Policy or a Fascist Policy that grants no Presidential Power**, begin a new round with a new Election.

#### ⛔ Veto Power

* Permanent ability available **after 5 Fascist policies** where the Chancellor may propose veto.
* The President draws three Policy tiles, discards one, and passes the remaining two to the Chancellor as usual. Then Chancellor may, instead of enacting either Policy, say “I wish to veto this agenda.”
  * If the President consents by saying, “I agree to the veto,” both Policies are discarded and the President placard passes to the left as usual.
  * If not, Chancellor must enact a Policy.
* Each use of the Veto Power represents an inactive government and advances the Election Tracker by one

### 🧨 Executive Action (Fascist Policy Only)

This phase aims to exercise governmental power.

* If the fascist policy covers a power slot:

  * President must use it immediately. Gameplay cannot continue until the President uses the power.
  * Before using a power, the President is free to discuss the issue with other players, but ultimately the President gets to decide how and when the power is used. Presidential Powers are used only once; they don’t stack or roll over to future turns.

#### 👊 Possible Presidential powers

* **Investigate Loyalty:** the president asks for the Party Membership card of a player and checks their party affiliation in secret, and then returns it to the player. The president can then share or lie the results of their investigation. 🚫 **No player can be investigated twice in the same game**
* **Call Special Election:** the president chooses any other player at the table to be the next Presidential Candidate by passing that player the President Placard.
  * The new President nominates an eligible player as Chancellor Candidate and the Election proceeds as usual.
    * 🔁 A Special Election does not skip any players. After a Special Election, the President placard returns to the left of the President who enacted the Special Election.
    * ⚠️ If the President passes the presidency to the next player in the rotation, that player would get to run for President twice in a row: once for the Special Election and once for their normal shift in the Presidential rotation.
* **Policy Peek:** secretly view top 3 tiles.
* **Execution:** eliminate a player
  * If Hitler, Liberals win.
  * If not, the table should not learn the party affiliation of the assassinated.
  * Executed players are removed from the game and may not speak, vote, or run for office.

## 🧾 New Rules from Secret Hitler XL

### ⚒️ New Party: The Communists

#### ⚙️ Setup

* Less than 11 players: communists **don’t know each other**.
* 11 or more: communists **do know each other**.
* Policy deck:

  * Standard: 8 communist, 5 liberal, 10 fascist policies.
  * 8 players: 8 communist, 6 liberal, 9 fascist policies.

#### 🏆 Win Conditions

1. Fill the communist policy tracker.
2. Assassinate Hitler (liberals also win).

#### 👊 Special Communist Presidential Powers

* **Confession:** president reveals **their** party membership to everyone.
* **Bugging:** communists view another player’s party card.
* **Five-Year Plan:** add 2 communist + 1 liberal policy to draw deck.
* **Congress:** communists learn who the original communists are.
* **Radicalization:** convert a player into a communist by swapping their party card with another in the center of the table (except Hitler and Capitalist, if any of those is converted, before everyone opens their eyes they must swap their card back).

#### 📊 Communist Tracker

* **6–8 players:** 5 slots — Bugging, Radicalization, Plan, Congress.
* **9–10 players:** 6 slots — adds Confession.
* **11+ players:** 6 slots — 2x Radicalization, Plan, Confession.
* **Short game variant:** 3 slots — Confession, Radicalization. Requires liberal tracker of 3 and policy deck with 10 fascist, 4 liberal, 6 communist policies.

---

### 💼 New Role: The Capitalist

* TBD: party for the capitalist
* **Wins** if **neither the communists nor the anarchist** win, which means the capitalist wins if **either the liberals or the fascists win** ONLY when a communist party or an anarchist is present.
* If assassinated: add 1 communist policy to the deck.
* **Cases in which the Capitalist is useful:**
  * If the communists have the upper-hand because policies are being enacted too quickly, you can add the capitalist to the game because of its win condition. The capitalist can be detrimental to the communists without giving an advantage to the other parties
  * If the communists are having difficulty winning because they cant seem to assasinate Hitler, you can include the Capitalist. That way, communists have a secondary assasination target.

---

### 🧨 New Role: The Anarchist

#### 🅰️ Without Communists

* TBD: party for the anarchist
* **Wins** if an **anarchist policy is enacted via election tracker**.
* ⚠️ The policy deck must be constructed with 3 anarchist policies.
* Every anarchist policy enacted shuffles a new anarchist policy into the draw deck and moves the election tracker to the end, and thus the policy at the top of the draw pile is enacted.
  * Anarchist policies add randomness. Instead of selecting a policy, the top card of the deck is enacted. This can help Fascists deflect suspicion, but as more anarchist policies are used and the more enter the deck, the chance of random, dangerous outcomes increases, especially late in the game.

#### 🅱️ With Communists

* Part of the communist team.
* Replace 2 communist policies with anarchist ones.
* If an anarchist policy is enacted:

  * **Counts for communist win** and its placed on the communist tracker, but **no presidential power is used** by the communists.
    * *Example:* if an anarchist policy is enacted on top of radicalisation, no new communist gets radicalised, but the communists are one policy closer to winning.
* 🏆 **Wins** if:

  * Communists win **and 2 anarchist policies** are in their tracker.
  * Hitler is assassinated.

If the communists have an advantage, you can introduce the anarchist to the game.

---

### 👑 New Role: The Monarchist

* A fascist who distrusts Hitler, he must protect him but make sure he never rises to power.
* 🏆 **Wins** if fascists win **and Hitler never became Chancellor after 3 fascist policies**.
* **Loses** if Hitler is assassinated.

If the fascists have an advantage, you can place a monarchist inside the fascist party.

---

## ❌ Anti-Policies

Anti-Policies help extend the game and balance roles in large groups. They replace standard policies and remove previously enacted ones while blocking the reuse of presidential powers. Use Anti-Fascist and Anti-Communist policies to weaken their respective factions, and Social Democratic policies to aid liberals—only if they are clearly disadvantaged.

* *Example:* If you are playing with Communist, you might want to swop out a Communists policy with an antifascist policy and a fascist policy with an anti-fascist policy to extend the game length.

The maximum number of players in a game of Secret Hitler is equal to the number of spaces on all policy trackers minus one, minus two if you’re playing with communists.

* This is because if you include any more players than that you will be guaranteeing that the game doesn’t last long enough for everyone to have an opportunity to become president or chancellor.

### **Anti-Communist Policy:**

* Goes on fascist policy tracker when its enacted.
* The president uses their presidential power and removes a communist policy from the communist policy tracker.
* The next time a communist policy is enacted, the president/communists do not get to reuse the communist presidential power.

### **Anti-Fascist Policy:**

* Goes on communist policy tracker when its enacted.
* The president uses their presidential power and removes fascist policy from the fascist policy tracker.
* The next time a fascist policy is enacted, the president does not get to reuse the presidential power.

### **Social Democratic Policy:**

* Goes on liberal policy tracker when its enacted.
* The president removes either fascist or communist policy from either policy tracker.
* Neither the communists nor the fascists may reuse any presidential powers because of this policy.
* ⚠️ Only use if liberals are significantly disadvantaged.

---

## ⚖️ Adjusting Liberal Strength

* To weaken liberals: use a **6-slot liberal tracker**.
* Helps extend the game for larger groups.

---

## 🚨 Emergency Powers

Use to balance games with more than 10 players:

* **Extend** game time.
* **Increase** chances for investigations and assassinations so that non-fascist players can assassinate Hitler.

### 👊 Emergency Powers

* 💡 Include **1 emergency card per player over 10** (2 per over 13 if communists are in play). Max: 6 total (3 Article 48, 3 Enabling Acts).

#### ✒️ **Article 48 (President)**

* The president gets to enact an emergency power.
* Once the emergency power is enacted remove that Emergency power card from the game.
* Article 48 Emergency Powers:

  * *Propaganda*: view top card of the policy deck and discard or put it back on top of the draw pile.
  * *Policy Peek*: view top 3 cards, do not reorder.
  * *Impeachment*: Chancellor reveals their party to someone chosen by the president (someone other than the president).
  * *Marked for Execution*: player is executed after 3 fascist policies being enacted.
  * *Execution*: execute a player. Don’t reveal role unless Hitler or Capitalist.
  * *Pardon*: cancel a marked execution.

#### 🪶 **Enabling Act (Chancellor):**

* Same as above but by the chancellor.
* Replaces *Pardon* with *Vote of No Confidence*: enact the discarded policy.
